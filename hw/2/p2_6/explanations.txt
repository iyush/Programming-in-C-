Explanations:

If we comment the line:

using namespace std;

in Critter.cpp. The compiler will not detect "string" in line:

void Critter::setName(string& ...

and it will not know that cout and endl means in: 

void Critter::print() {
        cout << "I am " << name << ". My hunger level is " << hunger << "." << endl;
}

if order to fix this we can either either uncomment the namespace or mention the name of the class these methods(string, cout and cin) belong to for example:

void Critter::print() {
        std::cout << "I am " << name << ". My hunger level is " << hunger << "." << std::endl;
}

void Critter::setName(std::string& ...

If we comment remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the methods in Critter.cpp. We get similar errors of undeclared variables. We can mitigate the error by rementioning class names. We could have used: 

use namespace Critter;

but we must first declare the namespace definition in order to do so.
